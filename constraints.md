# Evidence‑Based Hypertrophy Programming Rules (Training Only)

---

## 1. Core Definitions

* **Working set**: A set heavy and hard enough to measurably stimulate hypertrophy (see RIR rule below).
* **RIR (Reps in Reserve)**: Estimated reps left before true failure.
* **Weekly volume**: Number of **counted working sets per muscle** per week.
* **Primary muscle**: Main target of the exercise (e.g., pecs in flat bench).
* **Secondary muscle**: Strongly involved but not the main target (e.g., triceps/delts in bench).
* **MEV (Minimum Effective Volume)**: Lowest weekly set volume that produces measurable hypertrophy.[1][2][3]
* **MAV (Maximum Adaptive Volume)**: Volume range that yields the fastest gains while still recovering.[3][1]
* **MRV (Maximum Recoverable Volume)**: Highest weekly volume a lifter can recover from without performance regression over several weeks.[2][1][3]
* **Microcycle**: Typically 1 training week.
* **Mesocycle**: 4–8 weeks of organized training before a deload.

## 2. Global Programming Rules (Summary)

### Non‑Negotiable Logic Rules

1. **Weekly volume per muscle**

   ```text
   Weekly volume per muscle ∈ [MEV, MRV]
   ```

   * < MEV → maintenance or negligible growth
   * > MRV → accumulating fatigue, stalled performance, regression[4–8]

2. **Secondary muscle volume (fractional counting)**

   * Primary muscle: `1.0` set
   * Major secondary muscles: typically `0.5` set

3. **RIR requirement for a set to count**

   * Set counts only if `RIR ≤ 4` (ideal `RIR ≤ 2`)[8–10]
   * Light loads (≤30% 1RM): `RIR ≤ 1` required[9–12]

4. **Frequency before volume escalation**

   * If per‑session sets > ~8–10 and performance drops → increase frequency before adding sets

5. **Cumulative fatigue**

   * Fatigue carries across sessions and muscles
   * Declining performance at fixed RIR across weeks → likely ≥ MRV

6. **Load × Volume × RIR interdependence**

   * Effective hypertrophy range: ~30–85% 1RM when near failure
   * Very low loads (~20% 1RM) are sub‑optimal

---

## 3. Volume Rules

### 3.1 Dose–Response for Sets

* Clear dose–response up to moderate–high volumes[4–8]

**Volume ranges (conceptual):**

* Low: < ~10 sets/week
* Moderate: ~10–20 sets/week
* Very high: > 20 sets/week

**Rule 3.1 — Volume landmarks**

* **MEV**: Above low‑volume thresholds (~6–8 sets/week)
* **MAV**: Typically ~10–20 sets/week with stable performance
* **MRV**: Performance or recovery impairment at higher volumes

**Implementation logic**

```text
< MEV → increase volume
[MEV, MAV] → maintain or slow progression
Near MRV → hold briefly, then deload
> MRV → reduce volume
```

---

## 4. Frequency Rules

### 4.1 Equal Volume

* When weekly volume is equalized, 1–3×/week frequencies yield similar hypertrophy[14–16]

### 4.2 Managing Fatigue

```text
If per‑session sets > ~8–10 AND performance drops,
increase frequency before adding weekly sets.
```

---

## 5. Load, Intensity, and RIR

### 5.1 Load Range

```text
Effective range: ~30–85% 1RM
Avoid <30% unless at true failure
```

### 5.2 RIR Criteria

```text
Counts if:
- Load ≥ ~30% 1RM
- RIR ≤ 4

Preferred:
- RIR 0–3 for most work
- Light loads: RIR 0–1
- Heavy loads: RIR 1–3
```

### 5.3 Failure Usage

* Use sparingly
* Primarily on isolation exercises
* Prefer last sets

---

## 6. Rest Intervals

```text
Heavy multi‑joint: ≥ 2–3 min
Single‑joint/light: 1.5–2.5 min
```

Short rests that reduce performance lower per‑set stimulus.

---

## 7. Exercise Selection & Volume Counting

### 7.1 Fractional Accounting

```text
Primary muscle: 1.0 set
Major secondary: ~0.5 set
```

**Examples**

* Bench: Chest 1.0, Triceps 0.5, Delts 0.5
* Squat: Quads 1.0, Glutes 0.5, Erectors 0.5

### 7.2 Specialization

* Push priority muscles toward upper MEV–MRV
* Ensure ≥1–2 primary‑mover exercises

---

## 8. Fatigue & Progression

### 8.1 Monitoring Fatigue

```text
Improving/stable performance → ≤ MRV
Stagnation (2–3 wks) → near MRV
Regression → > MRV → reduce volume
```

### 8.2 Progression Hierarchy

```text
1. Progress load/reps at fixed RIR
2. Add sets toward MAV/MRV
3. Near MRV: hold volume
4. Deload after 4–8 weeks
```

---

## 9. Reconciling Contradictions

* **Frequency**: Control weekly sets; use frequency for fatigue management
* **Load**: 30–85% 1RM effective; avoid ~20%
* **Volume**: Individual MEV/MRV determined by performance
* **Failure**: Selective use; RIR 0–3 baseline

---

## 10. Minimal Ruleset (Quick Reference)

```text
1. Weekly sets per muscle ∈ [MEV, MRV]
2. Count only hard sets (RIR ≤ 4)
3. Use fractional counting for compounds
4. Increase frequency before per‑session volume >10
5. Rest adequately
6. Use failure selectively
7. Track performance trends
8. Progress load → then volume → then deload
```

## 12. Long‑Term Periodization

### Mesocycle Template

```text
Weeks 1–4: Build
Weeks 5–6: Hold near MRV
Week 7: Deload (−30–50% volume)
Week 8: Re‑baseline
```

---

## 13. Individualization

### MEV Discovery

```text
Start low → add sets until progress appears
Lowest effective volume = MEV
```

### MRV Discovery

```text
Increase volume until performance regresses → back off 20–30%
```

---

## 14. Special Populations

* **Beginners**: Lower MEV/MRV, fewer sets
* **Advanced**: Higher volumes, more frequent deloads
* **Older lifters**: Longer rests, slower progression
* **Concurrent cardio**: Separate sessions; monitor fatigue

---

## 15. Common Rule Violations

1. Counting easy sets
2. Double‑counting compounds
3. Pushing beyond MRV
4. Inadequate rest
5. Failure on every set
6. Skipping deloads
